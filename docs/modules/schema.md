# Schema

We use `Schema` to define the structure of the data. It is a very important concept in `Promptulate`. The schema is composed of Message and MessageSet classes, which encapsulate the data structure for dialogues and conversations.

## Message

A `Message` is a fundamental building block for dialogues in `Promptulate`. It represents a single unit of communication in a conversation, whether it's from the system, the user, or the assistant (AI). Each `Message` object contains the content of the message and any additional metadata that may be relevant. There are four types of messages:

- `SystemMessage`: Represents messages that provide instructions or context for the conversation, typically not displayed to the end user.
- `UserMessage`: Represents messages that come from the human user, indicating their input or questions.
- `AssistantMessage`: Represents messages generated by the AI assistant in response to the user.
- `CompletionMessage`: Used specifically in the context of OpenAI's API to represent a message that is a completion of a prompt.

Each message type inherits from the `BaseMessage` class, which ensures that every message has a consistent structure and set of properties.

## MessageSet

A `MessageSet` is a collection of `Message` objects that together represent a full conversation or a segment of a conversation. It is the main data structure used to manage the flow of dialogue between the user and the assistant. `MessageSet` provides methods for converting the messages to different formats required by various language models (`LLMType`) or for serialization purposes.

`MessageSet` includes methods for adding new messages of different types to the conversation, such as `add_user_message` or `add_ai_message`, which take the message content as input and create the appropriate `Message` object.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you might use `MessageSet` and `Message` in a `Promptulate` application:

```python
import promptulate as pne
from promptulate.schema import AssistantMessage, MessageSet, SystemMessage, UserMessage

messages = MessageSet(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assitant"),
        UserMessage(content="Hello?"),
    ]
)

llm = pne.ChatOpenAI()
answer: AssistantMessage = llm.predict(messages)
print(answer.content)
print(answer.additional_kwargs)
```

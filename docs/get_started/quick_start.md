### 2.1 Chat something by pne.chat()

`pne.chat()` is the most powerful function in pne. In actual LLM Agent application development, 90% of the functions can be built using it.

Now let's see how to use `pne.chat()` to chat with the model. The following example we use `gpt-4-turbo` to chat with the model.

```python
import pne

response: str = pne.chat(messages="What is the capital of China?", model="gpt-4-turbo")
```

**Output:**

```text
Beijing
```

It's easy, right?

### 2.2 Support for third-party models

You may wonder how to use `pne.chat()` to chat with other models, such as cohere or deepseek.

Promptulate integrates the capabilities of [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), supporting nearly all types of large models on the market, including but not limited to the following models:

The powerful model support of pne allows you to easily build any third-party model calls.

Now let's see how to run local llama3 models of ollama with pne.

```python
import pne

resp: str = pne.chat(model="ollama/llama2", messages=[{"content": "Hello, how are you?", "role": "user"}])
```

🌟 2024.5.14 OpenAI launched their newest "omni" model, offering improved speed and pricing compared to turbo.

You can use the available multimodal capabilities of it in any of your promptulate applications!

```python
import pne

messages=[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
            },
        ],
    }
]
resp = pne.chat(model="gpt-4o", messages=messages)
print(resp)
```

Use `provider/model_name` to call the model, and you can easily build any third-party model calls.

For more models, please visit the [litellm documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

You can easily build any third-party model calls using the following method:

### Config your key

在使用 pne 之前，你需要先导入你的`OPENAI_API_KEY`，你可以使用两种方式进行导入。

**方法一（不推荐）**

```python
import os

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "your-key"
```

在你第一次使用的时候，需要使用`os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]` 导入"OPENAI_API_KEY"的环境变量，但是在第一运行之后`promptulate`会进行缓存，即后面再运行就不需要再导入key了。

如果你的key过期了，可以尝试重新按照上面的方法导入key，或者你也可以把 `cache` 文件给删除掉，通过以下代码可以获取到缓存文件的位置:

```python
from promptulate.utils import get_default_storage_path

print(get_default_storage_path())
```

**方法二（推荐）**

方法二是 pne 官方推荐的最佳实践，你可以通过创建 `.env` 的方式来导入 key，与上面的配置效果是等价的。 [env 的使用方式](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)

在项目根目录下创建 `.env` 文件，然后填入你的 key:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
```

### pne.chat()

pne.chat() 是 pne 中最强大的函数，在实际的 LLM Agent 应用开发中，90% 的功能你都可以用它来完成搭建。

此外，在 pne 中，你可以抛去所有组件的概念，pne 渐进式的学习方式，可以让你在不需要了解其他组件详细概念的情况下，快速上手开发一个简单的 LLM Agent 应用，下面我们将介绍如何使用 pne.chat() 进行 All in one。

> 关于 pne.chat() 详细参考 [pne.chat()](/use_cases/chat_usage.md#chat)

在 LLM 应用开发中，格式化输出是 LLM 应用开发鲁棒性的重要基础，我们希望 LLM 可以返回稳定的数据，使用 pne，你可以轻松的进行格式化输出，下面的示例中，我们使用 pydantic 的 BaseModel 封装起一个需要返回的数据结构。

```python
from typing import List
import pne
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class LLMResponse(BaseModel):
    provinces: List[str] = Field(description="List of provinces name")

resp: LLMResponse = pne.chat("Please tell me all provinces in China.?", output_schema=LLMResponse)
print(resp)
```

**Output:**

```text
provinces=['Anhui', 'Fujian', 'Gansu', 'Guangdong', 'Guizhou', 'Hainan', 'Hebei', 'Heilongjiang', 'Henan', 'Hubei', 'Hunan', 'Jiangsu', 'Jiangxi', 'Jilin', 'Liaoning', 'Qinghai', 'Shaanxi', 'Shandong', 'Shanxi', 'Sichuan', 'Yunnan', 'Zhejiang', 'Taiwan', 'Guangxi', 'Nei Mongol', 'Ningxia', 'Xinjiang', 'Xizang', 'Beijing', 'Chongqing', 'Shanghai', 'Tianjin', 'Hong Kong', 'Macao']
```

在 pne，你可以轻松集成各种不同类型不同框架（如LangChain，llama-index）的 tools，如网络搜索、计算器等在外部工具，下面的示例中，我们使用 LangChain 的 duckduckgo 的搜索工具，来获取明天上海的天气。

```python
import os
import pne
from langchain.agents import load_tools

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key"

tools: list = load_tools(["ddg-search", "arxiv"])
resp: str = pne.chat(model="gpt-4-1106-preview", messages = [{ "content": "What is the temperature tomorrow in Shanghai","role": "user"}], tools=tools)
```

在这个示例中，pne 内部集成了拥有推理和反思能力的 [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) 研究，封装成 ToolAgent，拥有强大的推理能力和工具调用能力，可以选择合适的工具进行调用，从而获取更加准确的结果。

**Output:**

```text
The temperature tomorrow in Shanghai is expected to be 23°C.
```

此外，受到 [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) 论文的影响，pne 还允许开发者构建具有计划、推理、行动等处理复杂问题的能力的 Agent，通过 enable_plan 参数，可以开启 Agent 的计划能力。

![plan-and-execute.png](./docs/images/plan-and-execute.png)

在这个例子中，我们使用 [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/) 作为搜索引擎，它是一个强大的搜索引擎，可以从网络上搜索信息。要使用 Tavily，您需要从 Tavily 获得一个API密钥。

```python
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "your_tavily_api_key"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_api_key"
```

在这个例子中，我们使用 LangChain 封装好的 TavilySearchResults Tool。

```python
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)]
```

```python
import promptulate as pne

pne.chat("what is the hometown of the 2024 Australia open winner?", model="gpt-4-1106-preview", enable_plan=True)
```

**Output:**

```python
import pne
from promptulate.tools import (
    DuckDuckGoTool,
    Calculator,
)


def main():
    tools = [
        DuckDuckGoTool(),
        Calculator(),
    ]
    agent = pne.ToolAgent(tools=tools)
    prompt = """Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"""
    agent.run(prompt)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

运行结果如下：

To integrate a variety of external tools, including web search, calculators, and more, into your Python application, you can use the promptulate library alongside langchain. The langchain library allows you to build a ToolAgent with a collection of tools, such as an image generator based on OpenAI's DALL-E model. 

Below is an example of how to use the promptulate and langchain libraries to create an image from a text description:

> You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key. Click [here](https://undertone0809.github.io/promptulate/#/modules/tools/langchain_tool_usage?id=langchain-tool-usage) to see the detail.

```python
import pne
from langchain.agents import load_tools

tools: list = load_tools(["dalle-image-generator"])
agent = pne.ToolAgent(tools=tools)
output = agent.run("Create an image of a halloween night at a haunted museum")
```

output:

```text
Here is the generated image: [![Halloween Night at a Haunted Museum](https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-OyRC1wqD0EP6oWMS2n4kZgVi/user-JWA0mHqDqYh3oPpQtXbWUPgu/img-SH09tWkWZLJVltxifLi6jFy7.png)]
```

### Output Formatter

很多时候，LLM 的输出具有很强的不可控性，promptulate 通过 JSON schema 为 LLM 的输出构建了一个输出格式化器，简单来说，你可以用这种方式制定 LLM 的输出内容，并转换成一个 python 对象。

虽然 pne.chat() 已经集成了该功能，但是在必要的时候，你也可以讲此组件拆出来单独使用。

下面的示例展示了在 WebAgent 中使用格式化输出的最佳实践：

```python
import pne
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class Response(BaseModel):
    city: str = Field(description="City name")
    temperature: float = Field(description="Temperature in Celsius")


def main():
    agent = pne.WebAgent()
    prompt = f"What is the temperature in Shanghai tomorrow?"
    response: Response = agent.run(prompt=prompt, output_schema=Response)
    print(response.city, response.temperature)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

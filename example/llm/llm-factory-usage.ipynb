    "## What's different between LLMFactory and pne.chat() ? \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMFactory is the basic component of the pne.chat model driver for creating LLM models. So at most time, you don't need to use LLMFactory directly. If you are developing a chatbot, you need to use pne.chat() to chat and make a structure of response. Eg:\n",

    "import promptulate as pne\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n",

    "\n",

    "- If you want to use OpenAI, HuggingFace, Bedrock, Azure, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama, Sagemaker, Replicate, etc., please use pne.chat() directly. It's a simple and easy way to chat.\n",
